# Bitcoin Price Analysis: Market Trends, Technical Insights, and Investment Considerations  

## Introduction to Bitcoin  
Bitcoin (BTC), launched in 2009, represents the world's first decentralized digital currency built on blockchain technology. Its core design limits the total supply to 21 million coins, creating inherent scarcity that drives its value proposition. The network operates through a global network of nodes, ensuring transaction transparency and immutability. Key features include:  
- **Decentralized governance** without central authority  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism** for transaction validation  
- **Pseudonymous transaction system** balancing privacy and transparency
