# Bitcoin: Selling Surges, But Strong Demand Holds the Line  

Wed 02 Jul 2025 ▪ 4min read ▪ by Mikaia A.  

Bitcoin appears to be lingering below recent peaks, fluctuating within a $100,000–$110,000 range. While it occasionally dips, it rebounds with surprising resilience. This pattern isn’t a sign of weakness but rather a calculated market adjustment. Behind the volatility lies a silent transfer of Bitcoin between seasoned holders and new investors. Is this a pause before the next surge? Let’s analyze the dynamics shaping this phase.  

## Key Observations  

- **Massive profits realized by long-term holders** without triggering significant price drops.  
- **Institutional and retail demand absorbs selling pressure**, maintaining equilibrium.  
- **Historical July trends suggest potential for a summer rally**.  
- **195 days of consolidation** hint at pent-up energy awaiting release.

## From Veterans to Novices: Bitcoin Changes Hands  

Since May, **millions in BTC have shifted ownership** without destabilizing the market. According to Glassnode data, **$2.46 billion in profits were locked in a single day**, far exceeding the annual average of $1.14 billion. While this pales next to late-2024 peaks ($4–5 billion), it underscores sustained activity.  

**Long-term holders (LTHs)**, particularly those with 3–10 years of holding, dominate selling. Breakdown:  
- **$849 million** from 3–5-year holders  
- **$485 million** from 7–10-year holders  
- **$445 million** from 1–2-year holders  

Yet the price remains stable. As Yonsei Dent of CryptoQuant notes:  

> _“Despite this steady LTH selling, the price hasn’t broken down. This means the market is absorbing the sell pressure—implying new demand is coming in.”_  

Dent frames this as a healthy rotation: “This kind of healthy rotation (from strong hands to new buyers) is essential. LTH spending isn’t a warning sign—it’s actually a constructive signal.”

## July’s Historical Edge: A Rally in the Cards?  

Bitcoin has historically performed well in July. Since 2013, it averages **+7.56% growth**, with **8 out of 12 Julys showing gains**, including a **24% spike in 2020**. Analyst CryptoCon highlights the current cycle’s prolonged stagnation: “This is day 195 of sideways price action since December 18th. All major moves so far have occurred in short bursts totaling just 36 days.”  

**Interpretation**: Extended consolidation often precedes explosive moves. If history repeats, BTC could surge **to $140,000–$150,000** before settling again.  

### Key Metrics to Watch  
| Metric | Value | Context |  
|--------|-------|---------|  
| Single-day profits | $2.46B | Highest in 2025 |  
| Weekly average profits | $1.52B | Above annual average |  
| 3–5 year holder sales | $849M | Largest contributor |  
| July average gain (2013–2024) | 7.56% | Bullish precedent |  
| Stagnation duration | 195 days | Sets up potential breakout |

## Market Absorption and Liquidity Dynamics  

The absence of price collapse amid heavy selling suggests **robust institutional and retail demand**. Notably, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has dwindled to **15%**, nearing critical thresholds observed in past cycles. A liquidity crunch could trigger sudden volatility, favoring buyers over sellers.

## FAQ: Addressing Investor Concerns  

**Q: Why isn’t Bitcoin dropping despite heavy selling?**  
A: Strong demand from institutional buyers and retail investors is offsetting LTH exits, creating a balanced market.  

**Q: What does LTH selling indicate?**  
A: It signals profit-taking rather than capitulation. Historically, this phase precedes renewed accumulation by new buyers.  

**Q: Is July always bullish for Bitcoin?**  
A: While not guaranteed, July has averaged **+7.56% growth since 2013**, with notable spikes like the 2020 rally.  

**Q: Could liquidity shortages affect BTC’s price?**  
A: Yes. With exchange reserves at 15%, a sudden surge in buying pressure could accelerate gains due to reduced sell-side liquidity.

## Final Outlook: Consolidation Before the Next Leg  

The 195-day consolidation phase has created a technical setup for a potential breakout. Combined with historical July strength and absorbed selling volumes, the stage is set for a summer rally. Investors should monitor exchange reserves and on-chain activity for early signals of a move toward $140,000–$150,000.
