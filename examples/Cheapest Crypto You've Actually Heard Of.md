## Frequently Asked Questions  

### **Q1: Are low-priced cryptocurrencies safer investments?**  
A1: Price alone doesn‚Äôt determine safety. Market capitalization, underlying technology, and adoption rates are more critical metrics. Even cheap cryptos can be highly volatile.  

### **Q2: What‚Äôs the difference between market cap and price?**  
A2: Market cap (price √ó circulating supply) reflects a crypto‚Äôs overall value, while price alone doesn‚Äôt account for supply. A low price with a high market cap (e.g., XRP) indicates broader adoption.  

### **Q3: Should I invest in meme coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu?**  
A3: Meme coins are speculative and driven by social sentiment. They carry significant risk but can offer high rewards for those who conduct thorough research and allocate only disposable income.  

### **Q4: How do stablecoins like Tether maintain their value?**  
A4: Stablecoins are typically backed by reserves (e.g., fiat, commodities) to maintain pegs. Tether claims full dollar backing, though transparency remains a topic of debate.
