## Understanding C2C Trading

### What is C2C Trading?

C2C trading (also known as P2P trading) involves direct transactions between two parties without intermediaries. Imagine buying a fish at a market: you and the seller agree on a price, then exchange goods. In crypto, this translates to trading fiat currencies (e.g., USD, TWD) for digital assets like **stablecoins** (e.g., USDT) or **Bitcoin (BTC)**. Platforms like **Binance** act as facilitators, offering tools to connect buyers and sellers securely.

### Key Features of C2C Trading
- **Decentralized Exchange**: No central authority controls transactions.
- **Price Negotiation**: Users set or accept prices based on market dynamics.
- **Security Measures**: Platforms often freeze seller assets until payment is confirmed.
